Why should business care about Continuous Delivery?
===================================================

At its core, Continuous Delivery is about delivering features to
production as soon as they are ready. This rapid delivery has several
benefits for both business and development. First and foremost it lets
us adapt continuously and rapidly to feedback and changes in
the market—it enables us to gain insights from real usage. As a result
we have a better basis for knowing if we are building the right product,
and the value of new features is earned as soon as they are finished.

A lot has been said and written about the technical aspects of
continuous delivery—why it reduces overhead for development by
automating everything that can be automated. This blog post, however,
will focus on three core _business_ aspects of delivering continuously.

Smaller deltas of change means lower risk
-----------------------------------------

We call the amount of changes between two deploys the _delta of change_.
Reducing this delta means that less can go wrong when a new version is
deployed. Why? Both from a technical and business perspective it is far
easier to pinpoint the problem when there are less changes in the
product. By delivering fewer changes at a time we can be more certain
that we are actually delivering the _right thing_.

When releasing fewer changes it is also easier for business to
understand the impact of each additional change. This enables us to learn
more about what really earns value and not waste money building features
that don't add value.

Also, fewer changes means that we can deploy more often. And deploying
more often means shorter feedback loops. And shorter feedback loops
means we will learn more about the end users' needs at short and regular
intervals.

Shorter feedback loops
----------------------

There is a feedback loop between the team developing the product and the
users using it: The development and delivery of the product, the
users usage of it, the interpretation of this usage, and the final
decision regarding possible changes to the product and the strategy.
Delivering continuously shortens this feedback loop, which enables
customers to learn more—and more rapidly—about end users and making
the correct decisions on further development faster.

The developers of a product often have several layers between them and
the end users. Small code changes delivered often means shorter feedback
loops, which will increase the developers understanding of how the users
actually use the product. This improvement can lead to improved decisions
and technical innovations that are more aligned with what the user needs
and the customer wants. The more you know your users, the easier it is
to build the right thing.

Increased responsiveness
------------------------

By continuously delivering small changes rapidly you can empower your
customer to be more responsive with regards to users, the market, and
competitors. Increased responsiveness means that you are able to adapt
faster to user needs and market changes. Hence the faster you are
able to deliver on a customer request the happier and more satisfied the
customer will be.

Why keep a feature that is already developed and ready for production
just lay around waiting to be deployed in a year? Or for that matter, in
a month or a week? A feature only adds value after being put into production,
if not it's only _inventory waste_.
