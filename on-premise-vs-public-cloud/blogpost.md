Spare capacity
--------------

The main reason why a public cloud provider is able to provide a self-serviced platform for many customers is because they have a lot of spare capacity, which they're economically incentivized to have. Without spare capacity you'd get resource contentions between different clients and that would reduce their income. If you use an on-premise operations platform instead, something else happens. With on-prem you'll have economic incentives to _not_ have spare capacity, because spare capacity is wasted money. And that simply will not do if the on-premise operations platform is viewed as a cost center. The unfortunate result is that the operations platform will become a scarce resource. Scarce resources are protected and this protection will reduce autonomy.
