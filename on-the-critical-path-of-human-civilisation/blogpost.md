On the Critical Chain of Human Civilisation
===========================================

Not everything there is do be done is worth doing. It largely depends on your vision for humanity's future. Some things are beneficial and some things are directly harmful.

If you care about the future of human civilisation you should also care about what you do in the short term. In this article I will propose a framework for reasoning about what activities are worth doing.


## What is a critical chain really?




A critical chain

- Businesses on the critical chain
- Businesses supporting the here and now, the other pats
- Businesses harming the critical chain, i.e. _parasitic businesses_

Why are there not any _neutral_ businesses? Because the neutrals would still use talent and resources that could support the critical path.

- Consign ourselves to our species ineviteble death on exhaust ourselves in one large party and destroy ourselves in a few years
- Do our best to improve as long as we can avoid the heat death of the universe

Oblivion awaits us in either case.
