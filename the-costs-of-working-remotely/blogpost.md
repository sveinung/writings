# The Costs of Working Remotely

Or why Metcalfe's law makes human interaction diffucult.

If you have ever tried working with anybody you have probably experienced that communication can be quite hard. The spoken face-to-face word is hardly a perfect representation of ideas since we rely so much on shared contexts (like common history). The spoken face-to-face word might not even be a good one, but it is enormously more efficient than anything modern technology has been able to come up with. Bad news for those who like to work from home!

In this article I will explore some of the forces that impacts communication negatively and how that relates to remote work.


## More people, more pain

Metcalfe's law states that the effect of a network is proportional to the number of actors in the network squared. Or more formally: Effect = n(n-1)/2

Interaction costs: The costs related to every interaction between people. If two colleagues need to communicate to get some work done it will incur a cost.

Communication is 30% vocal (tone of voice, inflection, etc.), 60% non-verbal (e.g. body language), but only 10% percent verbal (i.e. words only). Have you ever chatted with someone who came across as inpolite or insensitive over the wire, but all sweet and gentle while in person? That is probably because that person has not learned the limitations of the chat medium.

We'll explore two models
- A: Multiple distributed groups within a larger team
- B: A team distributed 100%. Noone works with anybode else in a physical sense.

## The Path of Least Resistance

Just like electricity, communication follows the path of least resistance. If you use model A and someone on one of the teams needs a sparring session they will most start those communication lines incurring the least interaction costs, or in other words, they will speak to whoever is closest. Most people find it much easier to express ideas in person when they can draw and gesticulate. At least for the time being, digital communication expend more calories than physical communication. Human beings have not yet experiences natural selection for chatting abilities. What you get is that communication will flow more freely within physical groups and communication across physical locations will be neglected. The alternative is to start neutering people with poor communication skills.

Interactions costs include:
- Geographical distance
- Available communication media (phone)


## Conclusion

- Metcalfe's law
- Least resistance
